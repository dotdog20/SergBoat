# Contributing
FredBoat is built using Maven, so you should just be able to import the project in your favorite IDE and download all dependencies while building. Check out the [issues](https://github.com/Frederikam/FredBoat/issues) to find out what needs to be done.

When submitting a pull request, please submit against the `development` branch, or you will have to reopen your PR. 

## Code conventions
Code is indented with 4 spaces and without brackets on newlines. Please use the logging system (SLF4J) instead of `System.out` or `System.err`.

## Issue labels

* **Intermediate** Means that the issue might be somewhat more difficult.
* **Advanced** Means that the could be a major feature or requires a deep understanding of the bot.

These 4 tags all imply that help is wanted, so feel free to contribute at whichever level. Please announce your intention to work on something so we don't accidentally try to write the same changes!

Also feel free to work on your own ideas. Especially commands, we can't have too many of those.
