 * This class uses a headless browser to circumvent the CloudFlare basic javascript challenge protection
 * Attention: Yes, this runs wild javascript from the interwebs (the ones we request, that is) and executes it for a few
 * seconds. Shouldn't be a problem as the underlying Javascript engine seems sandboxed.
